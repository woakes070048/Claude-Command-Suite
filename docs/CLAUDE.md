## Command Structure

Each command file follows a consistent markdown structure:
- Title with `# Command Name`
- Brief description
- Detailed step-by-step instructions under `## Instructions`
- Commands accept arguments via `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder

## Installation Methods

The repository supports three installation methods via `install.sh`:
1. **Project-specific** (`--project`): Installs to `./.claude/commands/`
2. **Global** (`--global`): Installs to `~/.claude/commands/`
3. **Symlink** (`--symlink`): Creates symbolic links for development

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Workflows**: Each command provides systematic, step-by-step approaches
- **Cross-Language Support**: Commands adapt to different programming languages and frameworks
- **Best Practices**: Built following Anthropic's Claude Code Best Practices
- **Modular Design**: Commands can be used independently or in sequence
- **Customizable**: Command files can be modified for project-specific needs

## Usage Patterns

Commands are typically used in workflows like:
```
/project:code-review                    # Assess current state
/project:create-feature user-dashboard  # Implement feature
/project:security-audit                 # Verify security
/project:performance-audit              # Check performance
```

## Development Notes

When working on this repository:
- Command files use markdown format with specific structure requirements
- The install script requires bash and handles cross-platform installation
- Commands are designed to be language-agnostic but provide specific guidance for common tech stacks
- Each command emphasizes thorough analysis before making changes
