## How It Works

Claude Code automatically recognizes any markdown file in your project's `.claude/commands/` directory as a slash command. No installation or setup required - just add the file and start using it!

### Command Structure
Each command file needs:
- **Title**: `# Command Name`
- **Description**: Brief overview of what the command does
- **Instructions**: `## Instructions` section with detailed steps

Example minimal command (`my-command.md`):
```markdown
# My Custom Command

Performs a specific task in my project.

## Instructions

1. **First Step**
   - Do this thing
   - Check that thing

2. **Second Step**
   - Execute this action
   - Verify the result
```

Use it immediately with: `/project:my-command`

### Using Commands
Commands are available as `/project:command-name` in Claude Code. Each command follows a structured workflow that Claude executes automatically, ensuring consistent and thorough results across different projects.

**Example workflows:**
- `/project:code-review` analyzes your entire codebase for quality, security, and performance
- `/project:create-feature dashboard` plans, implements, and tests a new dashboard feature
- `/project:fix-issue 123` systematically resolves GitHub issue #123 with testing

## Common Workflows

**New Feature Development:**
```bash
/project:code-review                    # Assess current state
/project:create-feature user-dashboard  # Implement feature
/project:security-audit                 # Verify security
```

**Bug Fixing:**
```bash
/project:fix-issue 456                  # Fix the specific issue
/project:code-review                    # Verify fix quality
```

**Code Maintenance:**
```bash
/project:dependency-audit               # Check for outdated dependencies
/project:performance-audit              # Identify bottlenecks
/project:refactor-code legacy-module    # Improve problematic areas
```

- **Description Extraction**: Pulls descriptions directly from command files
- **Backup Safety**: Creates backups before making changes

## Release Process

This project uses automated releases powered by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every merge to the main branch triggers our release workflow which:

1. **Analyzes commits** to determine version bump type
2. **Updates version** automatically based on commit types
3. **Generates release notes** from commit messages
4. **Creates GitHub releases** with downloadable bundles
5. **Updates changelog** with categorized changes

### Version Bumping Rules

- `fix:` commits ‚Üí Patch release (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
- `feat:` commits ‚Üí Minor release (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)  
- Breaking changes ‚Üí Major release (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

### Making Releases

Releases happen automatically when you:
1. Merge PRs with conventional commit titles
2. Push directly to main with conventional commits

For details on contributing and commit formats, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements

- Claude Code version 1.0 or later
- Commands work with any programming language or framework
